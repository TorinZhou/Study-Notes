# BEM: Block-Element-Modifier methodology

> BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element,
> Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS.

> Projects of any size with CSS can benefit from a BEM frameworkâ€”unless writing styles directly > inside already organized JavaScript files and using Styled Components or something similar. To > complement BEM, include some parts of SMACSS which act as a style guide for naming
> conventions. BEM is easy to read and organizes styles, even when projects are extremely large.

## How to implement BEM

There are three main parts of BEM.

- Block: which holds everything(element) inside and acts as a scope.
- Element: which acts as a specific part of the component.
- Modifier: which adds additional styles to a specific element(s).
