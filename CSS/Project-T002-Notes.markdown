# Notes

- shortcut icon
  <br><link rel="shortcut icon" href="./images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
  <br>Check favicon.io
- inpage link

  - <a href="#featured" class="btn hero-btn scroll-link">explore tours</a>

- border: 2px solid transparent. A transparent border will come in handy

- use pure color to be background on small screen, then media quary a background img on big screnn will help.

- To add icons, what are the differences between <i> and <span> with a child of <i> :

  - 图标是不同的，多个图标，但是 their span parent has the same class. Makes it easy to shape all icons easily.
  - An icon is just icon itself .If we put it in a span, it's easy to give the icon a background with other colors or border. by useing background to set background . and color to set icon color. Simply in the span element.

- <i class="fas fa-tree fa-fw"></i> fa-fw ：means icon has a fixed width
