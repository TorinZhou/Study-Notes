## What is a sentence?

1 Declarative (statement): This is a standard sentence that points out a fact.

Example: That dog won’t sit.

2 Interrogative (question): This is a sentence asking a question.

Example: Why won’t that dog sit?

3 Exclamatory (exclamation): This is a modified declarative sentence used to add emphasis or show emotion, urgency, or high volume.

Example: I’ve tried everything, but that dog still won’t sit!

4 Imperative (command): This is a sentence telling someone or something to do an action. The subject is assumed, so you don’t need to include it.

Example: Please sit.
