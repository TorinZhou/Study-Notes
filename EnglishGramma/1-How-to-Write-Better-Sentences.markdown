# [How to Write Better Sentences](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentences)

## What is a sentence?

1 Declarative (statement): This is a standard sentence that points out a fact.

Example: That dog won’t sit.

2 Interrogative (question): This is a sentence asking a question.

Example: Why won’t that dog sit?

3 Exclamatory (exclamation): This is a modified declarative sentence used to add emphasis or show emotion, urgency, or high volume.

Example: I’ve tried everything, but that dog still won’t sit!

4 Imperative (command): This is a sentence telling someone or something to do an action. The subject is assumed, so you don’t need to include it.

Example: Please sit.

## Sentence rules and structures

### Simple sentence structure

a standalone independent clause with a subject and verb. Note that a simple sentence can contain two subjects or two verbs, but not two of each.

Example: King Kong and Godzilla destroyed the city.

### Complex sentence structure

A complex sentence combines an independent clause with one or more subordinate clauses. Complex sentences always use `subordinating conjunctions` to connect the clauses.

Example: King Kong and Godzilla destroyed the city `because` they were fighting.

### Compound sentence structure

It’s essentially two simple sentences joined together. A compound sentence combines two independent clauses using a coordinating conjunction like the `FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)` or using a `semicolon => ;`.

Example: King Kong didn’t want to destroy the city, but Godzilla enjoyed it.

### Compound-complex sentence structure

Lastly, a compound-complex sentence has at least two independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause.

Example: After mustering all his strength, King Kong threw a final punch and Godzilla fell.
