# Technical Term: DOM

Javascript interact with a webpage = Doing DOM Manipulation

DOM and DOM Methods/Properties are not part of JS or ES. It's a part of something called web APIs. Which we can access from js code.

# Technical Term: API

WEB APIs are basicly libraries that are also written in JS and are automaticlly available for us to use (We don't have to import)

Besides DOM, There are actully a ton more APIs, such as fetch, timer.

# DOM Test

```javascript
"use strict";
// look what I get here  console.log(document.querySelector('.message'));
// console.log(document.querySelector('.message'));
// or document.querySelector('#message');

console.log(document.querySelector(".message").textContent);
// we select the element, and then from that element we select the property. which is textcontent.

document.querySelector(".message").textContent = "Im HERE !!";
// I change the content!

document.querySelector(".number").textContent = "999";

document.querySelector(".guess").value = 23;
console.log(document.querySelector(".guess").value);
```
