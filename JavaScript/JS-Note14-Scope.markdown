# Scope

- Global Scope
- Function Scope
- Block Scope (if, for)
  - (if we turn off 'use strict' , block scope will no longer exist).
  - and Var viarable will ignore block scope as well. (even in strict mode)
  - always use let/const.

# Same name Variables in different Scopes

They are completely different variables. No problem.
