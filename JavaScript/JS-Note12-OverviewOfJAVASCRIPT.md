# JAVASCRIPT

A HIGH-LEVEL PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED MUTIL-PARADIGM INTERPRETED OR JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED DYNAMIC SINGLE-THREADED GARBAGE-COLLECTED PROGRAMING LANGUAGE WITH FIRST-CLASS FUCNTIONS AND A NON-BLOCKING EVENT LOOP CONCURRENCY MODEL.

## High-level

- Low: Dev has to manage resources manually
- High: Dev does not have to worry. Easy. But will not as fast as low ones.

## Garbage-collected

- One of the important tool that take momery away from Devs.
- Cleaning the memory.

## Interpreted or Just-in-time compiled

- Compile(Convert as js code to machine code)

## Multi-paradigm

- An approach and mindset of struction code, which will direct your coding style and technique.
- procedural
- object-oriented (OOP)
- Functional programming (FP)
- JS can do all the above

## Prototype-based object-oriented

- Prototype inheritance
  - e.g. we can creat a array and use push.method (because array is object and inherit the push.method form prototype ) (A prototype is a blueprint)

## First-class function

- Functions are simply treated as variables. we can push them into other functions, and returen them from functions.

## Dynamic

- Dynamic Typed. (Variables)
- Typed of variables can easily changed
- e.g c java is not Dyanmic
- Typescript is JS with types.

## concurrency model

- How the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

## Single-threaded

- A thread is like a set of instructions that is executed in the computer's CPU. JS runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.

## Non-blocking event loop

- By using an event loop, takes long running tasks, excuteds them in the "background", and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.
